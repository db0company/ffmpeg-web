<p>
If you're running a business that uses FFmpeg or would like to use FFmpeg,
you will sometimes want to have an expert, i.e. one of the original
developers, work with you to figure out an issue, fix a bug or add
some new feature.
</p>

<p>
This page is a list of those FFmpeg developers that are available for
employment or consulting. The FFmpeg project highly recommends these people
to be hired by your business. All developers on this list maintain some
code in FFmpeg,
which serves as a testimony for their competence. By hiring one of these
developers, your business can also (indirectly) support the development
of FFmpeg.
</p>

<p>
If you do not know whom to hire in particular or if none of the listed
areas of expertise fits your requirements, you can send an email to
the <a href="contact.html">ffmpeg-devel mailing list</a>, where it will
reach a wider audience.
