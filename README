Generate the ffmpeg.org website.

-----

npm, lessc and bower are required to generate the website.[1]

Generate the website using `make`. It will create 2 versions:
- `htdocs` contains the version to use in development. Thanks to lessc, you can edit the
  *.less sources and see the changes on your browser without having to reload it.
- `dist` containes the website to use in production. It contains the minimum required files
  only. It has to be up-to-date on the repo so the production server doesn't have to install
  all the dependencies.

`make clean` will only remove the development website generated files.
Type `make distclean` to remove the production website generated files as well.

[1] Install instructions, 3 methods:

- Install everything globally (root required)
  - Install npm from the packages or the sources: http://nodejs.org/
  - Install lessc and bower using npm:
    $ sudo npm install -g bower less

- Install only npm globally
  - Install npm from the packages or the sources: http://nodejs.org/
  - Install lessc and bower in the current directory using npm:
    $ npm install bower less
  - Add the path to your environment:
    $ export PATH=`pwd`/node_modules/bower/bin:`pwd`/node_modules/less/bin:$PATH

- Install everything locally
  - Run this script:
    $ ./local-npm.sh
  - Warning: it downloads and compiles npm from the sources, which takes a while
