This generates the ffmpeg.org website by fitting the navigation links onto
source files and dropping the result in the htdocs/ directory.

'make' generates the website, 'make clean' removes all generated files.

Note: npm, bower and lessc are required.
$ sudo aptitude install npm && sudo npm install -g bower && sudo npm install -g less && make

If you wish to install those locally (root not required), run this script instead:
$ ./local-npm.sh
