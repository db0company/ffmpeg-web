  <a id="opw01"></a><h3>July 3, 2014, FFmpeg and the Outreach Program For Women</h3>
  <p>
    FFmpeg has started the process to become an OPW includer organization for the
    next round of the program, with internships starting December 9. The
    <a href="https://gnome.org/opw/">OPW</a> aims to "Help women (cis and trans)
    and genderqueer to get involved in free and open source software". Part of the
    process requires securing funds to support at least one internship (6K USD), so
    if you were holding on your donation to FFmpeg, this is a great chance for you
    to come forward, get in touch and help both the project and a great initiative!
  </p>
  <p>
    We have set up an <a href="mailto:opw@ffmpeg.org">email address</a> you can use
    to contact us about donations and general inquires regarding our participation
    in the program. Hope to hear from you soon!

  <a id="heartbleed"></a><h3>April 18, 2014, OpenSSL Heartbeat bug</h3>
  <p>
    Our server hosting the Trac issue tracker was vulnerable to the attack
    against OpenSSL known as "heartbleed". The OpenSSL software library
    was updated on 7th of April, shortly after the vulnerability was publicly
    disclosed. We have changed the private keys (and certificates) for all
    FFmpeg servers. The details were sent to the mailing lists by
    Alexander Strasser, who is part of the project server team. Here is a
    link to the user mailing list
    <a href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2014-April/020968.html">archive</a>
    .
  </p><p>
    We encourage you to read up on
    <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/heartbleed.html">"OpenSSL heartbleed"</a>.
    <b>It is possible that login data for the issue tracker was exposed to
      people exploiting this security hole. You might want to change your password
      in the tracker and everywhere else you used that same password.</b>
  </p>

  <a id="trac_sec"></a><h3>February 9, 2014, trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach</h3>
  <p>
    The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
    installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
    and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
    FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
    and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
    to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
    That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
    Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend all users to change their passwords.
    <b>Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use
      elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.</b>
  </p>


  <a id="ffmpeg_rfp"></a><h3>November 12, 2013, FFmpeg RFP in Debian</h3>
  <p>
    Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed
    the Libav fork. Many people have requested the packaging of ffmpeg in
    Debian, as it is more feature-complete and in many cases less buggy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://cynic.cc/blog/">Rogério Brito</a>, a Debian developer,
    has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please let the Debian and Ubuntu developers know that you support packaging
    of the real FFmpeg! See Debian <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729203">ticket #729203</a>
    for more details.
  </p>
